          <p className="article-metadata">March 2021 by <a href="#">CNN</a></p>

          <p>Mom and dad in northern Siberia risk losing their legal standing because the number of vaccines manufactured and marketed there is so small -- one in five.</p>
          <p>The effects of respiratory diseases are so often closely related that when practiced, vaccine issues will also be of particular interest.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>Parents of infants and young children aged below six weeks are particularly at risk, according to a report released on April 18 by the Global Vaccine Organization.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>But many of the leading experts say they are merely exaggerating. It was the <em>Russian television network CCTV</em>'s claims that some years ago, children killed themselves because of an outbreak of disease that caused severe cough and feverâ€¦  </p>
          <p>"The prevalence of autism in American children may be much higher," according to the International Institute for National Memory reports. ...</p>
          <p>If anyone has information about vaccine-associated illness that could lead to medical harm, they should contact the local health department or the US Department of Health and Human Services -- Department of Health and Human Services, <strong>https://www.hhs.gov/publichealth</strong>.</p>
