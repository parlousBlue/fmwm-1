    "article": "Last year, studies found that high school students are smoking more electronic cigarettes.
These studies, which are conducted by teenagers, include e-cigarettes that are vaporized with flavors like strawberry or snow cone as well as a smokeless and flavored tobacco called tobacco gel.
This year, researchers found that approximately 10 percent of high school students have used e-cigarettes in 2018 \u2014 a percentage that increases significantly when compared to last year.
Additionally, 18 percent of high school students who do smoke tobacco use some form of e-cigarette, a slight increase from last year.
Data, provided by researchers and teachers at schools in many states, show that while many students do not recognize the dangers of e-cigarettes, the number of students who vaporize e-cigarettes in public is only expected to rise.

If vape pen users are younger than 18 years old, the process for getting an e-cigarette can often be halted with a visit to the principal\u2019s office.
