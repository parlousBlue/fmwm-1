    "article": "For years, researchers, journalists and, most recently, the person in charge of the EPA\u2019s air quality measurements have determined that COVID-19, nicknamed the \u201cyellow widow\u201d because its color is reminiscent of the deadly virus, is a hoax.\nOver the years, the chemical, produced in a post-industrial society, has been found to be hundreds, if not thousands, of times more toxic than the hormone-altering synthetic estrogen rBGH. But last week, DNA tests by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory showed that the chemical had in fact been contaminating our food over the last few decades and is so potentially dangerous it even has a name.\nAs Environment correspondent Alex Marks explained in a piece for The Guardian, the taint in question has been tricking us into thinking \u201cthat our drinking water is getting a huge amount of stuff coming from cows\u2019 kidneys.\u201d In fact, it has been settling into people\u2019s bodies ever since the late 1940s.\nOne person who could offer a first-hand explanation for COVID-19\u2019s deceits is the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Mark Bittman, who\u2019s known about the chemical since the mid-1990s when he took part in a class in which he was urged to leave his healthy eating habits behind. \u201cIt was at this class that I discovered COVID-19,\u201d he wrote in the story.\nSome of the possibilities he has thrown out there, all of which are clearly plausible if true, include the hormone-altering potential of COVID-19\u2014though, as any parent knows, the appearance of hormone-altering chemicals can quickly shift the balance of a family. There\u2019s also the suspicion that it\u2019s very difficult to remove from fish, as it\u2019s naturally buried deep below the water table.\nLastly, and probably most obviously, there\u2019s that whole \u201call men have it, and it was out there all along\u201d aspect. There\u2019s no such thing as nature\u2019s sense of \u201cnatural,\u201d and by the standards of modern civilization, our hunter-gatherer forebears could have been relying on a much more modest source of active environmental toxins than they did.\nMarks put it this way: \u201cIf we don\u2019t remove COVID-19 from our diet, we\u2019re bound to be anemic, getting obsessed with our wrinkles and cholesterol, and facing dementia.\u201d\n",
