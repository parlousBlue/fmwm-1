# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Misinformation is rampant across the internet and is immensely harmful to society.

We imagine a world where misinformation doesnâ€™t have a negative impact on society
Political and corporate interests serve only themselves, and confirmation bias is very common. Our Strategy: Use misinformation to convince people to the more factual and credible view for the wrong reasons. Intended for victims of misinformation and for educational and research purposes.
